# TOPSIS-Py: Python Package for TOPSIS Analysis

## Overview
TOPSIS-Py is a Python package designed for performing TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) analysis, a multi-criteria decision-making method. It helps users evaluate and rank alternatives based on their proximity to an ideal solution.

## Features
- **TOPSIS Analysis:** Compute TOPSIS scores and rankings for a given dataset and criteria.
- **Normalization:** Normalize the decision matrix using different normalization methods (e.g., min-max, standardization).
- **Weighted Decision Matrix:** Support for handling weighted decision matrices to reflect criterion importance.
- **Result Interpretation:** Interpret and understand the TOPSIS results including scores and rankings.
- **Validation:** Validate input data and parameters to ensure correct analysis.

## Installation
pip install Topsis-Kushagre-102103612
